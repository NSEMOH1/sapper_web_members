            A cooperative society is an organization owned and operated by a
            group of individuals for their mutual benefit. Members come together
            to meet common economic, social, and cultural needs, pooling
            resources to achieve goals that might be difficult to attain
            individually.

          <p>Key Features of Cooperative Societies</p>
          <OrderedList mt={4}>
            <ListItem>
              <span className="font-bold">Member Ownership:</span> Each member
              has an equal stake in the cooperative, regardless of their
              financial investment. This promotes a sense of community and
              shared responsibility.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              <span className="font-bold">Democratic Control:</span> Decisions
              are made collectively, usually following the principle of “one
              member, one vote.” This ensures that all voices are heard and
              valued.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              <span className="font-bold">Focus on Community Needs:</span>{" "}
              Cooperatives often prioritize local needs, whether through
              providing affordable goods and services, supporting local
              agriculture, or creating jobs.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              <span className="font-bold">Profit Distribution:</span>
              Profits are typically reinvested in the cooperative or distributed
              among members based on their participation, rather than solely on
              capital investment.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              <span className="font-bold">Education and Training:</span> Many
              cooperatives emphasize the importance of education, offering
              training to members to enhance their skills and knowledge, which
              benefits the cooperative as a whole.
